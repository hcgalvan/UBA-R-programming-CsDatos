This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
x <- c(0, 0.88, 0.3, 0.54, 2.81, 0.47, 0.86, 2.69, 6.02, 0.61, 1.54, 1.45, 1.33, 1.75, 2.83, 6.74, 0.31, 2.81, 1.56, 5.51, 1.18, 0.22, 10.72, 3.9, 2.74, 3.58, 0.61, 3.11, 1.38, 5.06, 0.08, 0.56, 3.47, 3.97)
```


```{r}
mean(x)
median(x)
sd(x)
mad(x)
```
```{r}
boxplot(x, horizontal = TRUE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
